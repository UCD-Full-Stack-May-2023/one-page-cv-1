      <h2>About Him</h2>
      <p>
        Thomas Sweeney is a web designer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. He has over five
        years
        of experience in designing and developing websites for various clients, ranging from small businesses to large
        corporations. He is proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress, and has a keen eye for aesthetics and
        usability.
        Thomas enjoys working with clients to understand their needs and goals, and delivering solutions that exceed
        their
        expectations. He is always eager to learn new skills and technologies, and to challenge himself with new
        projects. When
        he is not coding or designing, Thomas likes to spend his time reading, hiking, or playing video games.
